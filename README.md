Connect 4 using Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning
==========
Hi. This is my CS152 final. Set it up to run locally using the following commands:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/jdecked/cs152-final
$ cd cs152-final/src
$ yarn install
$ yarn build
$ python server.py
```

Then navigate to `localhost:8000` in your browser. Happy playing!
